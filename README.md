Classifying-newswires

Reuters Dataset

I will be working on the Reuters dataset, which is a set of short newswires and their topics, published by Reuters in 1986. Reuters is a simple, widely used toy dataset for text classification. There are 46 different topics, in which some topics are more represented than others, but each topic has at least 10 examples in the training set. The Reuters dataset comes packaged as part of Keras.

The aim of this project is to build a network to classify Reuters newswires into 46 mutually exclusive topics.
Hypothesis
- The outputs can be predicted given the inputs
- The available data is sufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs
